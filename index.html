<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I am a creative and technical nutjob in my mid 30&#39;s but I look 26 or so. I am aspiring to be a proficient graphic designer and I&#39;ve had some major successes along my ride to ultime design knowledge! A few years ago, I became a father of three and had the opportunity to sail the Seven Sea&#39;s in America&#39;s Finest Navy. That experience earned me the right to a free education at Eastern Washington University where I&#39;m attempting a BFA in Visual Communication Design. When I earn my degree I may become a freelancer or get a sweet gig at a Fortune 500 company while driving a sweet electric car and drinking coffee. </p>
